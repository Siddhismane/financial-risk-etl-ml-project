# Financial Risk Analysis (ETL + Machine Learning Project)

##  Objective
To build an end-to-end ETL pipeline and predictive model to identify High-Risk vs Low-Risk loan applicants.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow
1. Extracted 20,000 financial records from CSV dataset.
2. Performed data profiling and validation.
3. Engineered new feature: Loan-to-Income Ratio.
4. Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify repayment trends.
5. Built Logistic Regression model to predict loan repayment behavior.

## Result
Model achieved ~79% accuracy in predicting loan repayment risk.

##  Project Structure
- `data/` → Raw dataset
- `notebooks/` → ETL + Analysis code
- `report/` → Final project documentation

## Key Learning
Demonstrates how ETL + Feature Engineering + ML can support financial risk decision-making.
